###  1. Kerberos Protocol – Used for Secure Authentication

**Kerberos** is the default authentication protocol in Active Directory environments . It’s ticket-based protocol designed to authenticate users and services without sending passwords over the network.

Kerberos is designed to protect against **credential theft**, **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)** attacks, and **replay attacks** by using encrypted tickets instead of plaintext passwords

#### How it works:

1. **User logs in** → sends a request to the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)** (part of AD).
    
2. KDC verifies user and sends a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**.
    
3. When the user wants to access a service (like a file server), they use the TGT to request a **Service Ticket (ST)** from the KDC.
    
4. This ST is then used to access the service.
    

####  Security Benefits:

- **Mutual authentication** – both client and server verify each other.
    
- **Encrypted tickets** prevent credentials from being exposed.
    
- Reduces the need for password transmission over the network.

#### Attacker Techniques:

- **Kerberoasting:** Attackers extract encrypted service tickets (TGS) and brute-force them offline to get service account passwords.
    
- **Pass-the-Ticket:** Reuse of stolen Kerberos tickets to access services without needing credentials.
    



### 2. NTLM – Older Protocol (Less Secure)

**NTLM (NT LAN Manager)** is a challenge-response authentication protocol used before Kerberos. Still supported for backward compatibility, but **not recommended** for use due to security weaknesses.

####  Key Features:

- Relies on password hashes.
    
- No mutual authentication.
    
- Vulnerable to **pass-the-hash**, **relay attacks**, and **rainbow table attacks**.
    

####  Risks:

- Weak cryptography (uses MD4).
    
- Easily abused in **lateral movement** by attackers.

#### Attacker Techniques:

- **Pass-the-Hash (PtH):** If an attacker gets NTLM hashes, we can authenticate as the user.
    
- **NTLM Relay:** Attacker tricks a legitimate user to authenticate to them and relays to another system.



### 3. Access Control Lists (ACLs) – Define Permissions on AD Objects

ACLs in AD determine **who can access or modify** objects (like users, groups, computers, OUs).

#### Key Terms:

- **DACL (Discretionary ACL):** Defines who has what permissions (e.g., read, write, delete).
    
- **SACL (System ACL):** Defines what events get audited (e.g., log when a user is deleted).
    

#### Use Case:

You can allow a helpdesk user to reset passwords **only for users in a specific OU**, using ACLs.

#### Security Benefit:

Granular control over access reduces internal threat risks.
#### Attacker Techniques:

- **DCShadow Attack:** Attacker modifies AD schema by manipulating ACLs.
    
- **Permission Abuse:** If a user has `WriteDACL` on an object, they can escalate privileges.


### 4. Account Lockout Policies – Protect Against Brute Force Attacks

These policies define how many failed logon attempts are allowed before an account is locked, and for how long.

#### Key Parameters:

- **Account Lockout Threshold** – Number of failed attempts (e.g., 5).
    
- **Lockout Duration** – How long the account remains locked (e.g., 15 minutes).
    
- **Reset Counter** – Time before the failed attempts counter resets.
    

#### Security Purpose:

- Prevents **brute-force password guessing**.
    
- Slows down attackers attempting credential stuffing.

#### Attacker Techniques:

- **Password Spraying:** Attackers try common passwords across many accounts (avoids lockout).
    
- **DoS Attack:** Lock critical accounts like Domain Admins intentionally.

>  Too strict values can cause denial of service (e.g., attacker intentionally locking accounts).



### 5. Password Policies – Enforce Complexity, Length, Expiration

Password policies enforce rules on how users must create and manage their passwords.

#### Common Settings:

- **Minimum length** (e.g., 12 characters)
    
- **Complexity requirements** (must include uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
    
- **Maximum password age** (e.g., expire every 60 days)
    
- **Password history** (e.g., prevent reuse of last 10 passwords)
    

#### Security Goal:

- Prevent users from choosing **weak or common passwords**.
    
- Reduce the **window of opportunity** for attackers using stolen passwords.
    

#### Attacker Techniques:

- **Offline cracking** of stolen hashes.
    
- **Credential Stuffing:** Reuse of breached passwords.

> AD allows **Fine-Grained Password Policies** (FGPP) to apply different rules to different users/groups (e.g., admins vs. regular users).
