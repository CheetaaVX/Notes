## What is Active Directory?

**Active Directory (AD)** is a directory service developed by **Microsoft** for **Windows domain networks**. It stores information about **users, computers, groups, policies**, and other resources in a **centralized database**, and enables **authentication, authorization, and access control**.

- First introduced in **Windows 2000 Server**
    
- Widely used in **enterprise environments** to manage networks

### Core Components of Active Directory

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Domain**|Logical group of objects (users, computers, etc.) that share a common AD database|
|**Domain Controller (DC)**|Server that hosts a copy of the AD database and handles authentication|
|**Forest**|A collection of one or more domains sharing a common schema and global catalog|
|**Tree**|A group of one or more domains in a hierarchy within a forest|
|**Organizational Unit (OU)**|Container within a domain used to organize objects (like folders)|
|**Global Catalog (GC)**|A distributed data repository containing a searchable, partial representation of every object in every domain in a forest|
|**Schema**|Defines the structure and types of data stored in the directory|
|**Replication**|The process of synchronizing data across multiple domain controllers|

### How Active Directory Works

1. **Authentication**  
    User provides credentials → DC checks username/password → grants access.
    
2. **Authorization**  
    After login, AD checks **group memberships** and **permissions** for access.
    
3. **Group Policy**  
    Admins can push settings (desktop wallpaper, password policy, network settings) to users/computers via **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**.
    
4. **DNS Integration**  
    AD uses **DNS** for locating domain controllers and services.



### Common AD Objects :

| Object                        | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**                      | Represents a person                                     |
| **Computer**                  | Represents a device                                     |
| **Group**                     | Collection of users/computers for permission management |
| **OU (Organizational Unit)**  | Logical container for managing objects                  |
| **GPO (Group Policy Object)** | Set of rules applied to OUs, users, or computers        |
