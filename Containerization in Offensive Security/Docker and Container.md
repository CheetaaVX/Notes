# Container 

 A **Container** is a **lightweight, standalone, and executable environment** that includes everything needed to run a piece of softwareâ€”**code, libraries, system tools, and settings**â€”packaged together.

# Docker 

 **Docker** is a platform that uses **containerization technology** to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit called a **container**, which can run reliably in any computing environment.

##  Key Concepts:

- **Container**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software (code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, etc.).
    
- **Docker Image**: A read-only template used to create containers. It includes the application and all dependencies.
    
- **Docker Engine**: The runtime that builds and runs Docker containers.
    
- **Dockerfile**: A script with instructions to build a Docker image.
    
- **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry where Docker users can share and store images.
